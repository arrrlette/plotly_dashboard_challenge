# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard allows you to choose a patient via a dropdown menu and displays the top 10 UTI's found in that individual, a bubble chart displaying each OTU sample, the individuals demographic information, and the frequency in which they wash their belly button weekly. 

Plotly, D3, HTML/CSS, and Javscript were used in this project. D3 was used to read in the 'samples.json' file. 

The website was deployed using github pages: https://arrrlette.github.io/plotly_dashboard_challenge/
